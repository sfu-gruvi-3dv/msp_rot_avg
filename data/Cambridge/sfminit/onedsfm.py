This file provides an implementation of the 1DSfM algorithm described in the 2014 ECCV paper [1]. 1DSfM
preprocesses instances of the SfM Translations problem to detect outlier measurements. This makes
the problem easier to solve reliably.

Please refer to [1] for a full description of the principles behind the method. Briefly, a SfM
Translations problem is projected onto a single dimension, and an ordering problem is solved there.
Then results from many such ordering problems are aggregated in a voting procedure.
